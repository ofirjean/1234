Arnold-Ai is an AI-powered fitness profile generator built with a microservices architecture using Kubernetes, Flask, and MongoDB. Users fill out a form with physical stats, preferences, and training goals. The app then processes this data into a structured profile and sends it to an AI API that creates personalized workout recommendations.

ðŸ’¡ Core features being developed:

A form-driven user profile system

AI-assisted fitness recommendation engine

K8s-native deployment for modular scaling and maintenance

This project is currently under active development and will evolve into a robust, containerized AI fitness assistant. Stay tuned!
